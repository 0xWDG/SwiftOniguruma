# SwiftOniguruma

A wrapper for the [oniguruma](https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma) library.

### Development

To build the oniguruma dependency, run the `build_framework.sh` script from the root directory. This script will compile and package oniguruma into an xcframework and move it to the `Libs` directory.
